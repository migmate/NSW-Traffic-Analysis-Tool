# Project Overview

## Introduction
This project was born from a collaborative university assessment, where I took the lead in developing an innovative tool focused on data analysis and visualization. Leveraging a dynamic stack that includes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Ajax, and Flask, our tool aims to simplify the exploration and interpretation of complex datasets via a simple graphical interface.

## Features
Comprehensive Data Analysis The core functionality of our application is designed to enhance user engagement and insight extraction through several key features:

### Penalty Case Reporting:
Users can generate detailed reports of all penalty cases within a selected timeframe, enabling a focused analysis of data relevant to their needs.

### Offense Code Distribution Charting:
The tool provides visualizations of offense code distributions, offering a clear view of data trends and anomalies.

### Radar and Camera Incident Extraction:
It adeptly extracts incidents detected by radar or camera, highlighting specific areas of interest within the dataset.

### Mobile Phone-Related Offense Analysis:
A unique feature we developed is the analysis of mobile phone-related offenses. This functionality uncovers critical trends and patterns, offering new perspectives on the data.
